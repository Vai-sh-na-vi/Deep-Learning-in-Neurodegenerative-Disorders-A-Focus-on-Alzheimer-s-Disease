Alzheimer’s Disease Classification using CNN  

• **Model Development:** Built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras for multi-class classification of Alzheimer's disease.  
• **Data Augmentation:** Applied ImageDataGenerator to perform real-time data augmentation, enhancing model generalization and reducing overfitting.  
• **Architecture Design:** Designed a CNN architecture with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers, achieving 55% accuracy on the test dataset.  
• **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using classification reports and confusion matrices.  
• **Visualization:** Plotted training/validation accuracy, loss curves, and performance metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn for clear insights.  
• **Automation and Integration:** Automated data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in Google Colab with Google Drive integration for large-scale dataset management.
